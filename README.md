This is my advanced seminar
****
This part of the code only illustrates my work. Some .mat files in the program were created for other students in the group, and the training image set in deep learning is in the uni database, which I have no right to share. 
****
In this project, I present a numerical method, , called Hybrid-input-output(HIO), and deep learning convolutional networks to recover the phase from the far-field intensity-only images. In simulation, we validate this HIO algorithm and use different images and parameters to characterize the performance of this algorithm. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are compared.
